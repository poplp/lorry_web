coreIdea: 'Our brain operates on two systems: System 1 (Fast, Intuitive, Emotional) and System 2 (Slow, Deliberative, Logical). Understanding their interplay is key to making better decisions.'
quotes:
  - "Nothing in life is as important as you think it is, while you are thinking about it."
  - "We can be blind to the obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness."
  - "Intelligence is not only the ability to reason; it is also the ability to find relevant material in memory and to deploy attention when needed."
practicalGuidance:
  society: 'Recognize "Nudge" and framing effects. Policies can be designed to help the intuitive System 1 make better choices without restricting freedom.'
  learning: 'Cognitive ease (feeling familiar) is not the same as truth. To truly learn, we must engage System 2 through deliberate, often uncomfortable, effort.'
  work: 'Use the "Premortem" technique: Before a major decision, imagine it has failed a year later and write the history of that failure. This forces System 2 to overcome optimism bias.'
