coreIdea: 'Small, smart choices, plus consistency, over time, equals radical difference. Success is not about doing 5,000 things once, but doing 5 things 5,000 times.'
quotes:
  - "You will get in life what you tolerate."
  - "Small, Smart Choices + Consistency + Time = Radical Difference."
  - "You don't get in life what you want; you get in life what you are."
practicalGuidance:
  society: 'Understanding that societal changes happen gradually through the collective compound effect of individual actions.'
  learning: 'Dedicate 15 minutes a day to learning a new skill. In a year, that is over 90 hours of focused study.'
  work: 'Focus on small improvements in daily workflows. 1% better every day leads to 37x improvement in a year.'
